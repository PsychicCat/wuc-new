<h2>How Secure Is Monero?</h2>
Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network every transaction is cryptographically secured. Individual accounts have a 25 word mnemonic seed displayed when created, and can be written down to backup the account. Account files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.
<p>
<h2>How Private Is Monero?</h2>
Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the distributed ledger of transactions). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default.

<h2>How Traceable Is Monero?</h2>
By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.
